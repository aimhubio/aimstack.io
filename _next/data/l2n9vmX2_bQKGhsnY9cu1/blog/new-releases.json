The new audio and figure explorers now allow for the exploration of more types of metadata.\n* Aim remote tracking server was rolled out to enable tracking from multi-host environments.\n* Active monitoring capabilities were enabled, such as notifications for stalled runs, and the ability to programmatically define training heuristics using callbacks and notifications.\n* Aim was integrated with 9 different machine learning frameworks alongside with 3 convertors that help to migrate from other experiment trackers.\n* Last but not least, the documentation was completely revamped, including almost 40 pages of guides towards helping in effectively using and understanding Aim.\n\n# **Supported Platforms**\n\n\n\nImprovements were made to ensure Aim works seamlessly with widely used environments and platforms in ML/MLOps field, including adding support for new platforms.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*aYG-SSawh8Q8jte6BjyNMQ.png)\n\n\n\n* Support for running Aim on Apple M1 devices.\n* Support for using Aim inside Google Colab and Jupyter notebooks.\n* Docker images for Aim UI and server.\n* Support for running Aim in Kubernetes clusters.\n* Aim became available in Conda.\n\n# User Interface\n\n\n\nThe UI is one of key interfaces to interact with the ML training runs tracked by Aim. It’s super-powerful for comparing large number of trainings. The UI was significantly improved in the past year with new pages and explorers to help to explore more metadata types.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*odqgX33xLVzYBI6sfRYRWQ.png \"Home Page\")\n\n\n\n* Revamped home page to see project’s contributions and overall statistics.\n* Revamped run page to deep-dive into an individual run.\n* Brand new experiment page to view experiment’s details, attached runs, etc.\n* New explorers, such as the “Figures Explorer” and “Audio Explorer”, to allow a cross-run comparison of Plotly figures and audio objects respectively.\n* “Metrics Explorer” key enhancements, including displaying chart legends and the ability of exporting charts as images.\n\n\n\n# Command Line Interface\n\n\n\nAim CLI offers a simple interface to easily manage tracked trainings. Two key groups of commands were added:\n\n* **Runs management** to enable the base operations for managing trainings — list, copy, remove, move, upload, close.\n* **Storage management** to help to manage Aim data storage, such as reindexing, pruning, managing data format versions (advanced usage).\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*MZFkXFzmz5BxGYofUgWdTg.png)\n\n# Query Language\n\nAim enables a powerful query language to filter through all the stored metadata using python expressions. A few additions were done providing a more friendly and pythonic interface for working with date-time expressions, as well as querying runs based on its metrics results.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1284/format:webp/1*6J9gouDEt9Mkhv9Cds4dNw.png)\n\n# Remote Tracking\n\nThe Aim remote tracking server, which allows running trainings in a multi-host environment and collect tracked data in a centralized location, used to be one of the most requested features.\n\nIt has been gradually rolled out from its experimental phase to a stable version that can scale up and handle an increasing number of parallel trainings.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*CizfTBF8Nh4DZcun6TP8Pg.png)\n\nSwitching from a local environment to a centralized server is as easy as pie, as zero code changes are required.⚡\\\nThis is because the interfaces are completely compatible!\n\n# Active Monitoring\n\nAim made it first steps towards optimizing conducting long and large scale trainings, such as training or tuning GPT-like models. It reduces human-hours spent monitoring/restarting runs, improves reproducibility and ramps up time for people who need to train these models:\n\n* Ability to notify on stalled/stuck runs.\n* Callbacks and notifications to define training heuristics programmatically.\n\nA quote from “Scaling Laws for Generative Mixed-Modal Language Models” (Aghajanyan et al., 2023, [arXiv:2301.03728](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03728)):\n\n> We tracked all experiments using the Aim experiment tracker (Arakelyan et al., 2020). To ensure consistent training strategies across our experiments, we implemented a model restart policy using the Aim experiment tracker and callbacks. Specifically, if training perplexities do not decrease after 500 million tokens, the training run is restarted with a reduced learning rate with a factor of 0.8 of the current time step. This policy helps remove variance in the scaling laws due to differences in training procedures and allows us to scale up the number of asynchronous experiments significantly. All experiments were conducted in a two-month time frame with a cluster of 768 80GB A100 GPUs. The majority of experiments used 64 GPUs at a time.\n\n# Key Performance and Usability Optimizations\n\n* Storage: long metrics sampling and retrieval (>1M steps).\n* Storage: robust locking mechanism and automatic background indexing.\n* UI: The v3.12 milestone was released, addressing over 30 usability issues.\n* UI: virtualizations in various places across the UI to improve responsiveness when displaying large amount of data.\n* UI: optimizations in stream decoding and data encoding to enhance overall performance.\n* UI: live update optimizations to effectively update and display real-time data.\n\n# Integrations\n\nAim easily integrates with a large number of widely adopted machine learning frameworks and tools, reducing barriers to get started with Aim. During the past year, a number of integrations were added:\n\n* **ML Frameworks** — Pytorch Ignite, CatBoost, LightGBM, KerasTuner, fastai, MXNet, Optuna, PaddlePaddle\n* **Convertors** to easily migrate from other tools **—** TensorBoard to Aim, MLFlow to Aim, WandB to Aim.\n* **Tools that integrated Aim** — Meta’s fairseq and metaseq frameworks, HuggingFace’s accelerate, Ludwig and Kedro.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1358/format:webp/1*YT4Yf1sJUqQLWRtiF8fJgQ.png)\n\n# Learn More\n\n\n\nIf you have any questions join [Aim community](https://community.aimstack.io/), share your feedback, open issues for new features and bugs. 🙌\n\nShow some love by dropping a ⭐️ on [GitHub](https://github.com/aimhubio/aim), if you find Aim useful.","html":"<h1>A retrospective look at the past year</h1>\n<p>Aim underwent significant improvements in the past year.

Now you can track images during training and evaluation to explore them on the Aim UI.\n\nAll the regular grouping and search goodies are available on Images Explorer too \n\nAdd an image tracker in your training code like this:\n\n```\nrun.track(Image(tensor_or_pil, caption), name='gen', step=step, context={ \"subset\": \"train\" })\n```\n\nOnce you run your training, the images will be saved and become available on the Images Explorer tab.\n\nOn Images Explorer you can filter and group by the images all the params available (just like you would do for metrics). As a result, you get lots of flexibility to compare the runs via tracked images.\n\nHere is a quick promo video of what it can do. The rest of the details can be found in the docs[ here](https://aimstack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ui/pages/explorers.html).\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*3IkmtAOLGy-e3eJneuv2bA.png)\n\nA quick demo video.\n\n![](https://youtu.be/4mtUFV8yG_o)\n\nThe Images view on the single run page is coming soon …\n\n## Runs Navigation\n\nOne of the regressions from the Aim 2.x to [3.0.0](https://aimstack.io/blog/new-releases/aims-foundations-why-were-building-a-tensorboard-alternative) was the ability to navigate between the runs of the same experiment from the single run page.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*63UGGl2EDquqGHIY03VpQQ.png)\n\nWe have added that back as the top-most dropdown with the list of all experiments and their corresponding runs for easy navigation.\n\nSorry for the regression \n\n## Performance improvements and assurances\n\nTwo groups of performance improvements have been made— on the UI and on the SDK side.\n\n### **Column virtualization on Aim UI Table**\n\nThe ability to smoothly navigate through metrics and be able to interact with a table is surely the ultimate experience we aim to provide.\n\nWe are really proud of our craft and aim to make the best possible usage experience for the experiment comparison problem — and this is a key step towards  it. 🍻\n\n### **Storage performance tests**\n\nOne of the unique challenges in building Aim is to make sure each newly added data type won’t impact the overall performance.

Here is a glimpse of the UI:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*hdJPM1ggTMtdcri1htvZdg.png)\n\n## Text Search\n\nNow a comprehensive text searching is available to be able to outline the desired text. Regular Expressions are available among others.\n\nHere is a link for a quick [demo](http://play.aimstack.io:10004/runs/d9e89aa7875e44b2ba85612a/texts). And a glimpse of the UI:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*pt8sjFzpbhomdqRDwKb-Mw.png)\n\n## Trendline on scatterplots\n\nNow you can render a trendline over your scatterplots on Scatters Explorer. We have enabled linear and Loess trendline.\n\nThanks to [sjakkampudi](https://github.com/aimhubio/aim/issues/1160) for the help on this one.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*pndAq3SIevuTckBZ20wwqg.png)\n\n## More Images Features\n\nWe have added a number of new tools to the Images Explorer\n\n## Display Images by original size\n\nNow you can view & compare the tracked images by their original size. This has been a key missing ingredient for effective images comparison.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*vXgyBHiVPAV_8l6-im_P3A.png)\n\n## Align by width\n\nYou can also align images by their width. This is especially handy when long images are tracked, such as sound spectograms (40px / 1000px). This feature will allow to effectively compare such images.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*dHHMux9rYd1sLRX4OjLCeQ.png)\n\n## Images Sorting\n\nYou can also apply sorting of images by any tracked available parameter. In this case I have enabled sorting by step in descending order to see the later generated images in my GAN experiments. A lot smoother than the ones above.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*d4gA2EO7b0AI39YjcpLwIA.png)\n\n## Learn more\n\n[Aim is on a mission to democratize AI dev tools.](https://aimstack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html)\n\nWe have been incredibly lucky to get help and contributions from the amazing Aim community.

Here is a code snippet of easy it is to integrate Aim and Hugging Face.\n\n```\nfrom aim.hugging_face import AimCallback\nfrom transformers import Trainer\n\naim_callback = AimCallback(repo='/log/dir/path', experiment='your_experiment_name')\n\ntrainer = Trainer(\n       model=model,\n       args=training_args,\n       callbacks=[aim_callback]\n    )\n```\n\nHere is how it works: `aim_callback` will automatically open an Aim `Session` and close it when the trainer is done. When `trainer.train()`, `trainer.evaluate()` or `trainer.predict()` is called, `aim_callback` will automatically log the hyper-params and respective metrics.\n\nFind a full example [here](https://github.com/aimhubio/aim/blob/main/examples/hugging_face_track.py).\n\n## Metric Visibility Control\n\nWhen dealing with lots of experiments some metrics may need hide (while still being in the Search) to allow better visibility of the overall picture.\n\nA toggle is now available both for each metric/row as well as for global on/off. Check out the demo below:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*yZAWw55lUWVCa35zptdCrA.gif \"Hide individual metrics as well as collectively\")\n\n## Column resize\n\nWith lots of params tracked, some of them are too wide for table and take over the whole screen real estate. Column resize will allow to fully control data width on the table. Resize is available both on Explore and Dashboard tables.Here is a quick demo:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*KFUs6pmpqOCVhfdWMO6CVg.gif \"Drag column edges back-and-forth to resize\")\n\n## Hide columns with similar values\n\nMore often than not params have lots of repetition. Especially when tracking 100s of them. In that case the explore table becomes super-noisy.\n\nThis feature allows showing only the relevant info. This has been certainly the missing piece of the column management that many had requested. Here is a quick demo:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*klN4dR6T8nSHLqyvqIUjOg.gif \"Leave only different columns with a button click, if needed customize afterwards\")\n\n## Logscale\n\nOne of the must-have features that we hadn’t had a chance to work on.

He wasn’t going to send the training logs to a third-party cloud. Meanwhile, spending hours on Tensorboard bothered to focus on his actual research. That’s how we decided to build a Tensorboard alternative.\n\n[Gor](https://github.com/gorarakelyan) and I started hacking on an open-source library to store metrics and hyperparameters. In a month, mahnerak was using Aim 1.0 instead of Tensorboard to track, store, search and group his metrics.\n\nBy fall 2020, [Aim 2.0](https://aimstack.io/blog/new-releases/aim-v2-2-0-hugging-face-integration) launched as a free, open-source and self-hosted alternative to Weights and Biases, Tensorboard and MLflow. To our surprise even [r/MachineLearning loved it](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/jfgbij/project_aim_a_supereasy_way_to_record_search_and/).\n\n By spring 2021, mahnerak co-authoerd a paper [WARP](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.381/) ([code](https://github.com/yerevann/warp)): Word-level Adverserial ReProgramming on his ACL-published work. At that point Aim users had contributed over 100 feature requests already.\n\n## A scale problem\n\nBut Aim’s power users — who often do 5K+ runs —were hitting issues.\n\nAfter over 250 pull requests, 1.2K GitHub stars and 200 feature requests. *Live updates, image tracking, distribution tracking*… and Aim 2.0 was hitting the limits of Aim 1.0’s design.\n\nIn order to support the future, we had to make changes to the foundation now.\n\n## Launching Aim 3.0.0\n\nAn additional [317 pull requests](https://github.com/aimhubio/aim/milestone/13?closed=1) later, we are excited to launch Aim v3.0.0 !!!\n\nAs a result, the most important changes include:\n\n**A completely revamped UI**\n\n* Home page and run detail page\n* Runs, metrics and params explorers\n* Bookmarks and Tags\n\n**A completely revamped Aim Python SDK**\n\n* New and much more intuitive (but still quite vanilla) API to track your training runs\n* New and 10x faster embedded storage based on [Rocksdb](http://rocksdb.org/). This will allow us to store virtually any type of AI metadata. On the contrary, [AimRecords](https://github.com/aimhubio/aimrecords) was designed for metrics and hyperparams only.\n\nEnjoy the changes!\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*xbg148dzileheVdOALBMBg.gif)\n\n## Performance improvements\n\n* Average run query execution time on ~2000 runs: 0.784s.\n* Average metrics query execution time on ~2000 runs with 6000 metrics: 1.552s.\n* New UI works smooth with ~500 metrics displayed at the same time with full Aim table interactions (*for comparison, v2 was performant with limitation for only 100 metrics*).\n\n## Comparisons to familiar tools\n\n### Tensorboard\n\n**Training run comparison**\n\n* The tracked params are first class citizens at Aim. So, you can search, group, and aggregate via params. Aim allows to deeply explore all the tracked data (metrics, params, images) on the UI.\n* With Tensorboard alternative solution the users are forced to record those parameters in the training run name to be able to search and compare. This causes a super tedious comparison experience and usability issues on the UI when there are many experiments and params. After all, TensorBoard doesn’t have features to group, aggregate the metrics\n\n**Scalability**\n\n* Aim can handle 1000s of training runs both on the backend and on the UI.\n* TensorBoard becomes really slow and hard to use when a few hundred training runs are queried / compared.\n\nAim will have the beloved TB visualizations\n\n* Embedding projector.\n* Neural network visualization.\n\n### [](https://github.com/aimhubio/aim#mlflow)MLFlow\n\nMLflow is an end-to-end ML Lifecycle tool. Aim is focused on training tracking. In general, the differences of Aim and MLflow are around the UI scalability and run comparison features.\n\n**Run comparison**\n\n* Aim treats tracked parameters as first-class citizens. Users can query runs, metrics and images. Also, they can filter using the params.\n* MLflow does have a search by tracked config.

He wasn’t going to send the training logs to a third-party cloud. Meanwhile, spending hours on Tensorboard bothered to focus on his actual research. That’s how we decided to build a Tensorboard alternative.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/gorarakelyan\">Gor</a> and I started hacking on an open-source library to store metrics and hyperparameters. In a month, mahnerak was using Aim 1.0 instead of Tensorboard to track, store, search and group his metrics.</p>\n<p>By fall 2020, <a href=\"https://aimstack.io/blog/new-releases/aim-v2-2-0-hugging-face-integration\">Aim 2.0</a> launched as a free, open-source and self-hosted alternative to Weights and Biases, Tensorboard and MLflow. To our surprise even <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/jfgbij/project_aim_a_supereasy_way_to_record_search_and/\">r/MachineLearning loved it</a>.</p>\n<p>By spring 2021, mahnerak co-authoerd a paper <a href=\"https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.381/\">WARP</a> (<a href=\"https://github.com/yerevann/warp\">code</a>): Word-level Adverserial ReProgramming on his ACL-published work. At that point Aim users had contributed over 100 feature requests already.</p>\n<h2>A scale problem</h2>\n<p>But Aim’s power users — who often do 5K+ runs —were hitting issues.</p>\n<p>After over 250 pull requests, 1.2K GitHub stars and 200 feature requests. <em>Live updates, image tracking, distribution tracking</em>… and Aim 2.0 was hitting the limits of Aim 1.0’s design.</p>\n<p>In order to support the future, we had to make changes to the foundation now.</p>\n<h2>Launching Aim 3.0.0</h2>\n<p>An additional <a href=\"https://github.com/aimhubio/aim/milestone/13?closed=1\">317 pull requests</a> later, we are excited to launch Aim v3.0.0 !!!</p>\n<p>As a result, the most important changes include:</p>\n<p><strong>A completely revamped UI</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Home page and run detail page</li>\n<li>Runs, metrics and params explorers</li>\n<li>Bookmarks and Tags</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>A completely revamped Aim Python SDK</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>New and much more intuitive (but still quite vanilla) API to track your training runs</li>\n<li>New and 10x faster embedded storage based on <a href=\"http://rocksdb.org/\">Rocksdb</a>. This will allow us to store virtually any type of AI metadata. On the contrary, <a href=\"https://github.com/aimhubio/aimrecords\">AimRecords</a> was designed for metrics and hyperparams only.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Enjoy the changes!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*xbg148dzileheVdOALBMBg.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2>Performance improvements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Average run query execution time on ~2000 runs: 0.784s.</li>\n<li>Average metrics query execution time on ~2000 runs with 6000 metrics: 1.552s.</li>\n<li>New UI works smooth with ~500 metrics displayed at the same time with full Aim table interactions (<em>for comparison, v2 was performant with limitation for only 100 metrics</em>).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Comparisons to familiar tools</h2>\n<h3>Tensorboard</h3>\n<p><strong>Training run comparison</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The tracked params are first class citizens at Aim. So, you can search, group, and aggregate via params. Aim allows to deeply explore all the tracked data (metrics, params, images) on the UI.</li>\n<li>With Tensorboard alternative solution the users are forced to record those parameters in the training run name to be able to search and compare. This causes a super tedious comparison experience and usability issues on the UI when there are many experiments and params. After all, TensorBoard doesn’t have features to group, aggregate the metrics</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Scalability</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Aim can handle 1000s of training runs both on the backend and on the UI.</li>\n<li>TensorBoard becomes really slow and hard to use when a few hundred training runs are queried / compared.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Aim will have the beloved TB visualizations</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Embedding projector.</li>\n<li>Neural network visualization.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a href=\"https://github.com/aimhubio/aim#mlflow\"></a>MLFlow</h3>\n<p>MLflow is an end-to-end ML Lifecycle tool. Aim is focused on training tracking. In general, the differences of Aim and MLflow are around the UI scalability and run comparison features.</p>\n<p><strong>Run comparison</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Aim treats tracked parameters as first-class citizens. Users can query runs, metrics and images. Also, they can filter using the params.</li>\n<li>MLflow does have a search by tracked config. However, there is no feature availability such as grouping, aggregation, subplotting by hyparparams .</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>UI Scalability</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Aim UI can handle several thousands of metrics at the same time smoothly with 1000s of steps.
