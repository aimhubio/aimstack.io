Examples of such artifacts are the model checkpoints, training run configuration files, etc.\n\nStarting from the version 3.19, Aim provides the logging API for artifacts, and the UI for showing artifact's metadata.\n\n![Run Artifacts](/images/dynamic/run-overview-artifacts.png \"Run Artifacts\")\n\n## Artifacts logging SDK\n\nThere are only two steps for logging artifacts with Aim:\n\n1. Set the artifacts storage URI for the Aim Run:\n\n```\nimport aim\nrun = aim.Run()\n# Use S3 as artifacts storage\nrun.set_artifacts_uri('s3://aim/artifacts/')\n```\n\nAim will create directory with the name of \\`run.hash\\` and store all artifacts there.\n\nNote that setting artifacts storage URI is required only once per run.\n\n2. Log artifact object:\n\n```\n# Log run configuration files as artifacts\nrun.log_artifact('config.yaml', name='run-config')\n```\n\n## Storage backends\n\nCurrent implementation logs the artifacts to S3 as we found out together withe the community that it’s the most practical use-case for many teams.\n\nOnce logged, the artifact metadata will appear in the Aim UI Run details page.\n\n## New HTTP-based tracking server\n\nThe first and still experimental implementation of the Aim remote tracking server have been GRPC-based and had lots of issues around it. \n\nThe new Aim tracking server facilitates real-time logging of experiments from remote locations. This  command launches the server with specified configurations, including host, port, and associated repository.\n\nLike the UI, the server can also run in production or development mode (better debugging options).\n\n## Allow HF callback to initialize Aim run at init end\n\n\n\n### Previously\n\nImplementation of Hugging Face callback in Aim initializes the \\`Run\\` object at training begin time. This means if the users wanted to track any additional metrics they had to track before training finished while using \\`HFTrainer\\` object.\n\n### Now\n\nThis modification allows \\`HFTrainer\\` users to add more custom metrics by accessing the run object via \\`callback.experiment\\`. \n\nYou can now effortlessly track additional metrics or parameters in conjunction with the default metrics produced by HF, enriching data collection and analysis capabilities.\n\nSee docs [here.](https://aimstack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)[](https://aimstack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n\nSee the Release Notes [here.](https://github.com/aimhubio/aim/releases/tag/v3.19.0)\n\nWe're developing new features and improvements that we can't wait to show you!!\n\nThanks for all love and support.
