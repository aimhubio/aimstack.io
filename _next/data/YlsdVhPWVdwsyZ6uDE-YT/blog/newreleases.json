This is great for optimizing your model, making it easier to see when and how your model performs best or needs improvement.\n\n\n\nWhether it's identifying the peak accuracy of a classification model or the lowest error rate of a predictive model, this metric tracking simplifies the task of fine-tuning models for optimal performance.\n\n![Runs Explorer](/images/dynamic/screen-shot-2024-02-07-at-19.10.05.png \"Runs Explorer\")\n\n## SQLAlchemy 2.0 Support\n\n\n\nWe've added support for SQLAlchemy 2.0 to ensure you have the latest database management capabilities at your fingertips.\n\n\n\n## Improvements in Run Locking and Compatibility\n\n\n\nRun locking issues are fixed and we made sure everything works smoothly with older versions of SQLAlchemy.\n\nWe're developing new features and improvements that we can't wait to show you :))\n\n\n\nThanks for all love and support.
