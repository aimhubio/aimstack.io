Above all, this post highlights the two features of Aim 2.4.0. Please see the full list of changes [here](https://github.com/aimhubio/aim/milestone/6?closed=1).\n\n## XGBoost Inegration\n\n\n\nTo begin with,  `aim.callback` is now available that exports `AimCallback` to be passed to the `xgb.train` as a callback to log the experiments.\n\nCheck out this [blogpost](https://aimstack.io/blog/tutorials/an-end-to-end-example-of-aim-logger-used-with-xgboost-library/) for additional details on how to integrate Aim to your XGBoost code.\n\n## Confidence Interval as the aggregation method\n\n![](https://aimstack.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/confidence_interval.png)\n\nNow you can use confidence intervals for aggregation. The community has been requesting this feature, since it completes the list of necessary aggregation methods. As a result, if you have outlier metrics in your group, confidence interval will show logical aggregation and get better comparison of the groups. \n\n## Learn More\n\n\n\n[Aim is on a mission to democratize AI dev tools.](https://github.com/aimhubio/aim#democratizing-ai-dev-tools)\n\nWe have been incredibly lucky to get help and contributions from the amazing Aim community. It’s humbling and inspiring.\n\nCheck out the latest [Aim integration](https://aimstack.io/aim-v2-2-0-hugging-face-integration/)!\n\nTry out [Aim](https://github.com/aimhubio/aim), join the [Aim community](https://join.slack.com/t/aimstack/shared_invite/zt-193hk43nr-vmi7zQkLwoxQXn8LW9CQWQ), share your feedback, open issues for new features, bugs.\n\nAnd don’t forget to leave [Aim](https://github.com/aimhubio/aim) a star on GitHub for support.","html":"<p><a href=\"https://github.com/aimhubio/aim\">Aim</a> 2.4.0 featuring XGBoost Integration is out !

Please see the full list of changes <a href=\"https://github.com/aimhubio/aim/milestone/6?closed=1\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2>XGBoost Inegration</h2>\n<p>To begin with,  <code>aim.callback</code> is now available that exports <code>AimCallback</code> to be passed to the <code>xgb.train</code> as a callback to log the experiments.</p>\n<p>Check out this <a href=\"https://aimstack.io/blog/tutorials/an-end-to-end-example-of-aim-logger-used-with-xgboost-library/\">blogpost</a> for additional details on how to integrate Aim to your XGBoost code.</p>\n<h2>Confidence Interval as the aggregation method</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://aimstack.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/confidence_interval.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Now you can use confidence intervals for aggregation. The community has been requesting this feature, since it completes the list of necessary aggregation methods. As a result, if you have outlier metrics in your group, confidence interval will show logical aggregation and get better comparison of the groups. </p>\n<h2>Learn More</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/aimhubio/aim#democratizing-ai-dev-tools\">Aim is on a mission to democratize AI dev tools.</a></p>\n<p>We have been incredibly lucky to get help and contributions from the amazing Aim community.

Here is a code snippet of easy it is to integrate Aim and Hugging Face.\n\n```\nfrom aim.hugging_face import AimCallback\nfrom transformers import Trainer\n\naim_callback = AimCallback(repo='/log/dir/path', experiment='your_experiment_name')\n\ntrainer = Trainer(\n       model=model,\n       args=training_args,\n       callbacks=[aim_callback]\n    )\n```\n\nHere is how it works: `aim_callback` will automatically open an Aim `Session` and close it when the trainer is done. When `trainer.train()`, `trainer.evaluate()` or `trainer.predict()` is called, `aim_callback` will automatically log the hyper-params and respective metrics.\n\nFind a full example [here](https://github.com/aimhubio/aim/blob/main/examples/hugging_face_track.py).\n\n## Metric Visibility Control\n\nWhen dealing with lots of experiments some metrics may need hide (while still being in the Search) to allow better visibility of the overall picture.\n\nA toggle is now available both for each metric/row as well as for global on/off. Check out the demo below:\n\n![](https://aimstack.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/demo.gif \"Hide individual metrics as well as collectively\")\n\n## Column resize\n\n\n\nWith lots of params tracked, some of them are too wide for table and take over the whole screen real estate. Column resize will allow to fully control data width on the table. Resize is available both on Explore and Dashboard tables.Here is a quick demo:\n\n![](https://aimstack.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/demo2.gif \"Drag column edges back-and-forth to resize\")\n\n## Hide columns with similar values\n\n\n\nMore often than not params have lots of repetition. Especially when tracking 100s of them. In that case the explore table becomes super-noisy.\n\nThis feature allows showing only the relevant info. This has been certainly the missing piece of the column management that many had requested. Here is a quick demo:\n\n![](https://aimstack.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/demo3.gif \"Leave only different columns with a button click, if needed customize afterwards\")\n\n## Logscale\n\n\n\nOne of the must-have features that we hadn’t had a chance to work on. Finally it’s available!!\n\n![](https://aimstack.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/demo4.gif \"log-scale on Aim\")\n\n## New methods for aggregation\n\n\n\nNow you can select different types of aggregations as well as whether to see the whole area or just the aggregated lines.\n\n![](https://aimstack.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/demo5.gif)\n\n## Learn More\n\n[Aim is on the mission to democratize AI dev tools.](https://github.com/aimhubio/aim#democratizing-ai-dev-tools)\n\nWe have been incredibly lucky to get help and contributions from the amazing Aim community.

Find the full list of changes [here](https://github.com/aimhubio/aim/milestone/3?closed=1).\n\n## System Resource Usage\n\n\n\nNow you can use automatic tracking of your system resources (GPU, CPU, Memory, etc). In order to disable system tracking, just initialize the session with `system_tracking_interval==0`.\n\nOnce you run the training, you will see the following. Here is a demo:\n\n![](https://aimstack.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/demo-1.gif \"Aim automatic system resource tracking demo\")\n\nOf course you can also [query all those new metrics](https://aimstack.io/wp-admin/post.php?post=706&action=edit) in the Explore page and compare, group, aggregate with the rest of the metrics!\n\n## Reverse grouping (“against” the param)\n\n\n\nAs much as grouping is needed to divide pile of metrics by param values into manageable clusters for comparison, there are cases when the metrics need to be divided by everything BUT one param (yes, I am looking at you seed!). We have called it a Reverse Grouping. Here is how it works:\n\n![](https://aimstack.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/reverse-grouping-1024x566.gif \"Aim Reverse grouping demo\")\n\nUse the toggle next to switch between grouping modes.\n\n## Line Chart Smoothing\n\n\n\nNow you can apply smoothing on metrics. Here is how it works:\n\n![](https://aimstack.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/metric-smoothing.gif \"Aim metric smoothing\")\n\nThere are two type of smoothing options available: `Exponential Moving Average` and `Central Moving Average`.

It can have a huge impact on the training results. There are different ways of using the pseudorandom number generator in ML. Here are a few examples:\n\n* Initial weights of the model. When using not fully pre-trained models, one of the most common approaches is to generate the uninitialized weights randomly.\n* Dropout: a common technique in ML that freezes randomly chosen parts of the model during training and recovers them during evaluation.\n* Augmentation: a well-known technique, especially for semi-supervised problems. When the training data is limited, transformations on the available data are used to synthesize new data. Mostly you can randomly choose the transformations and how there application (e.g. change the brightness and its level).\n\nAs you can see, the random seed can have an influence on the result of training in several ways and add a huge variance. One thing you do not need when tuning hyper-parameters is variance.\n\nThe purpose of experimenting with hyper-parameters is to find the combination that produces the best results, but when the random seed is not fixed, it is not clear whether the difference was made by the hyperparameter change or the seed change. Therefore, you need to think about a way to train with fixed seed and different hyper-parameters. the need to train with a fixed seed, but different hyper-parameters (comes up)?.\n\nLater in this tutorial, I will show you how to effectively fix a seed for tuning hyper-parameters and how to monitor the results using [Aim](https://github.com/aimhubio/aim).\n\n## **How to fix the seed in PyTorch Lightning**\n\n\n\nFixing the seed for all imported modules is not as easy as it may seem. The way to fix the random seed for vanilla, non-framework code is to use standard Python`random.seed(seed)`, but it is not enough for PL.\n\nPytorch Lightning, like other frameworks, uses its own generated seeds. There are several ways to fix the seed manually. For PL, we use `pl.seed_everything(seed)` . See the docs [here](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/0.7.6/api/pytorch_lightning.trainer.seed.html).\n\n> Note: in other libraries you would use something like: `np.random.seed()` or `torch.manual_seed()` \n\n## **Implementation**\n\n\n\nFind the full code for this and other tutorials [here](https://github.com/aimhubio/tutorials/tree/main/fixed-seed).\n\n```\nimport torch\nfrom torch.nn import functional as F\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader\nfrom torchvision.datasets import CIFAR10\nfrom torchvision.models import resnet18\nfrom torchvision import transforms\nimport pytorch_lightning as pl\nfrom aim.pytorch_lightning import AimLogger\n\nclass ImageClassifierModel(pl.LightningModule):\n\n    def __init__(self, seed, lr, optimizer):\n        super(ImageClassifierModel, self).__init__()\n        pl.seed_everything(seed)\n        #

Use Aim to group the runs by metrics/hyper-parameters (this can be done both on Explore and Dashboard after [Aim 1.3.5 release](https://aimstack.io/mlops-tools-aim-1-3-5-activity-view-and-x-axis-alignment/)) and have multiple charts of different metrics on the same screen.\n\nDo the following steps to see the different effects of the optimizers\n\n* Go to dashboard, explore by experiment\n* Add loss to `SELECT` and divide into subplots by metric\n* Group by experiment to make all metrics of similar color\n* Group by style by optimizer to see different optimizers on loss and accuracy and its effects\n\nHere is how it looks on Aim:\n\n![](https://aimstack.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/10.gif)\n\n![](https://aimstack.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/11.png)\n\n\n\nFrom the final result it is clear that the SGD (broken lines) optimizer has achieved higher accuracy and lower loss during the training.\n\nIf you apply the same settings to the learning rate, this is the result:\n\n## For the next step to analyze how learning rate affects the experiments, do the following steps:\n\n\n\n* Remove both previous groupings\n* Group by color by learning rate\n\n![](https://aimstack.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/12.gif)\n\n![](https://aimstack.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/13.png)\n\nAs you can see, the purple lines (lr = 0.01) represent significantly lower loss and higher accuracy.\n\nWe showed that in this case, the choice of the optimizer and learning rate is not dependent on the random seed and it is safe to say that the SGD optimizer with a 0.01 learning rate is the best choice we can make.\n\nOn top of this, if we also add grouping by style by optimizer:\n\n![](https://aimstack.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/24.gif)\n\n![](https://aimstack.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/25.png)\n\nNow, it is obvious that the the runs with SGD optimizer and `lr=0.01` (green, broken lines) are the best choices for all the seeds we have tried.\n\nFixing random seeds is a useful technique that can help step-up your hyper-parameter tuning. This is how to use Aim and PyTorch Lightning to tune hyper-parameters with a fixed seed.\n\n## Learn More\n\n\n\nIf you find Aim useful, support us and [star the project](https://github.com/aimhubio/aim) on GitHub.

Use Aim to group the runs by metrics/hyper-parameters (this can be done both on Explore and Dashboard after <a href=\"https://aimstack.io/mlops-tools-aim-1-3-5-activity-view-and-x-axis-alignment/\">Aim 1.3.5 release</a>) and have multiple charts of different metrics on the same screen.</p>\n<p>Do the following steps to see the different effects of the optimizers</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Go to dashboard, explore by experiment</li>\n<li>Add loss to <code>SELECT</code> and divide into subplots by metric</li>\n<li>Group by experiment to make all metrics of similar color</li>\n<li>Group by style by optimizer to see different optimizers on loss and accuracy and its effects</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here is how it looks on Aim:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://aimstack.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/10.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://aimstack.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/11.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>From the final result it is clear that the SGD (broken lines) optimizer has achieved higher accuracy and lower loss during the training.</p>\n<p>If you apply the same settings to the learning rate, this is the result:</p>\n<h2>For the next step to analyze how learning rate affects the experiments, do the following steps:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Remove both previous groupings</li>\n<li>Group by color by learning rate</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://aimstack.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/12.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://aimstack.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/13.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>As you can see, the purple lines (lr = 0.01) represent significantly lower loss and higher accuracy.</p>\n<p>We showed that in this case, the choice of the optimizer and learning rate is not dependent on the random seed and it is safe to say that the SGD optimizer with a 0.01 learning rate is the best choice we can make.</p>\n<p>On top of this, if we also add grouping by style by optimizer:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://aimstack.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/24.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://aimstack.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/25.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Now, it is obvious that the the runs with SGD optimizer and <code>lr=0.01</code> (green, broken lines) are the best choices for all the seeds we have tried.</p>\n<p>Fixing random seeds is a useful technique that can help step-up your hyper-parameter tuning. This is how to use Aim and PyTorch Lightning to tune hyper-parameters with a fixed seed.</p>\n<h2>Learn More</h2>\n<p>If you find Aim useful, support us and <a href=\"https://github.com/aimhubio/aim\">star the project</a> on GitHub.
