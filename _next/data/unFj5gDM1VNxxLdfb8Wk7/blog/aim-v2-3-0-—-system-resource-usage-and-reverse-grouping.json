Find the full list of changes [here](https://github.com/aimhubio/aim/milestone/3?closed=1).\n\n## System Resource Usage\n\n\n\nNow you can use automatic tracking of your system resources (GPU, CPU, Memory, etc). In order to disable system tracking, just initialize the session with `system_tracking_interval==0`.\n\nOnce you run the training, you will see the following. Here is a demo:\n\n![](https://aimstack.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/demo-1.gif \"Aim automatic system resource tracking demo\")\n\nOf course you can also [query all those new metrics](https://aimstack.io/wp-admin/post.php?post=706&action=edit) in the Explore page and compare, group, aggregate with the rest of the metrics!\n\n## Reverse grouping (“against” the param)\n\n\n\nAs much as grouping is needed to divide pile of metrics by param values into manageable clusters for comparison, there are cases when the metrics need to be divided by everything BUT one param (yes, I am looking at you seed!). We have called it a Reverse Grouping. Here is how it works:\n\n![](https://aimstack.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/reverse-grouping-1024x566.gif \"Aim Reverse grouping demo\")\n\nUse the toggle next to switch between grouping modes.\n\n## Line Chart Smoothing\n\n\n\nNow you can apply smoothing on metrics. Here is how it works:\n\n![](https://aimstack.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/metric-smoothing.gif \"Aim metric smoothing\")\n\nThere are two type of smoothing options available: `Exponential Moving Average` and `Central Moving Average`. Further info of [how](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average) it’s calculated.\n\n## New aggregation modes\n\n\n\nWe have additionally added two more aggregation modes: `standard error` and `standard deviation` . Here is how it works:\n\n![](https://aimstack.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/aggr-modes.gif)\n\n## Learn More\n\n[Aim is on a mission to democratize AI dev tools.](https://github.com/aimhubio/aim#democratizing-ai-dev-tools)\n\nWe have been incredibly lucky to get help and contributions from the amazing Aim community.

Thanks to the awesome Aim community for testing this early and sharing issues, feedback.\n\nWithin a week after the [v3.1](https://aimstack.io/aim3-1-images-tracker-and-images-explorer/) we are releasing the v3.2 with a number of key highly requested features in:\n\n* Aim Jupyter Notebook extension (Colab is coming soon…)\n* Histogram tracking and visualization\n* Full-size images, images resize and render modes\n* Search autofill and suggest on the UI\n\n## Aim & Jupyter notebook\n\n\n\nNow you can use Aim fully from your Jupyter notebook. We have built an Aim Jupyter notebook extension that comes along with the `aim` package.\n\nYou don’t need to install anything other than Aim. Here are the [docs](https://aimstack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).\\\nA quick demo of integrating Aim & Jupyter Notebook::\n\n![](https://aimstack.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/1-3.gif \"It’s that easy to use Aim on your Jupyter notebook!\")\n\n## Histogram tracking and Visualization\n\nStarting from 3.2 you can track Distributions and visualize them as histograms on the run page.\n\nThis is how to track the weights distribution in your training code:\n\n```\nfrom aim import Distribution\n\nfor step in range(1000):\n    my_run.track(\n        Distribution(tensor), # Pass distribution\n        name='gradients', # The name of distributions\n        step=step,   # Step index (optional)\n        epoch=0,     # Epoch (optional)\n        context={    # Context (optional)\n            'type': 'weights',\n        },\n    )\n```\n\nThe [demo](http://play.aimstack.io:10003/runs/426032ad2d7e4b0385bc6c51), [docs](https://aimstack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and [examples](https://github.com/aimhubio/aim/blob/main/examples/pytorch_track.py) \n\nAnd this is how it looks on the UI. Aim lets you visualize the distributions every layer at every tracked step. Super powerful!\n\n![](https://aimstack.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/0.gif \"Visualize every layer and every tracked step.\")\n\n## Full-size images, images resize and render modes\n\n\n\nNow you can resize the tracked images size using the images resize tool available on the right hand tool-pain on the Images Explorer.\n\nHere is how it works:\n\n![](https://aimstack.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.gif \"Easily resize the queried images\")\n\nWe have also enabled smooth and pixelated images render modes.

Here is a code snippet of easy it is to integrate Aim and Hugging Face.\n\n```\nfrom aim.hugging_face import AimCallback\nfrom transformers import Trainer\n\naim_callback = AimCallback(repo='/log/dir/path', experiment='your_experiment_name')\n\ntrainer = Trainer(\n       model=model,\n       args=training_args,\n       callbacks=[aim_callback]\n    )\n```\n\nHere is how it works: `aim_callback` will automatically open an Aim `Session` and close it when the trainer is done. When `trainer.train()`, `trainer.evaluate()` or `trainer.predict()` is called, `aim_callback` will automatically log the hyper-params and respective metrics.\n\nFind a full example [here](https://github.com/aimhubio/aim/blob/main/examples/hugging_face_track.py).\n\n## Metric Visibility Control\n\nWhen dealing with lots of experiments some metrics may need hide (while still being in the Search) to allow better visibility of the overall picture.\n\nA toggle is now available both for each metric/row as well as for global on/off. Check out the demo below:\n\n![](https://aimstack.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/demo.gif \"Hide individual metrics as well as collectively\")\n\n## Column resize\n\n\n\nWith lots of params tracked, some of them are too wide for table and take over the whole screen real estate. Column resize will allow to fully control data width on the table. Resize is available both on Explore and Dashboard tables.Here is a quick demo:\n\n![](https://aimstack.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/demo2.gif \"Drag column edges back-and-forth to resize\")\n\n## Hide columns with similar values\n\n\n\nMore often than not params have lots of repetition. Especially when tracking 100s of them. In that case the explore table becomes super-noisy.\n\nThis feature allows showing only the relevant info. This has been certainly the missing piece of the column management that many had requested. Here is a quick demo:\n\n![](https://aimstack.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/demo3.gif \"Leave only different columns with a button click, if needed customize afterwards\")\n\n## Logscale\n\n\n\nOne of the must-have features that we hadn’t had a chance to work on.

He wasn’t going to send the training logs to a third-party cloud. Meanwhile, spending hours on Tensorboard bothered to focus on his actual research. That’s how we decided to build a Tensorboard alternative.\n\n[Gor](https://github.com/gorarakelyan) and I started hacking on an open-source library to store metrics and hyperparameters. In a month, mahnerak was using Aim 1.0 instead of Tensorboard to track, store, search and group his metrics.\n\nBy fall 2020, [Aim 2.0](https://aimstack.io/aim-v2-2-0-hugging-face-integration/) launched as a free, open-source and self-hosted alternative to Weights and Biases, Tensorboard and MLflow. To our surprise even [r/MachineLearning loved it](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/jfgbij/project_aim_a_supereasy_way_to_record_search_and/).\n\n By spring 2021, mahnerak co-authoerd a paper [WARP](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.381/) ([code](https://github.com/yerevann/warp)): Word-level Adverserial ReProgramming on his ACL-published work. At that point Aim users had contributed over 100 feature requests already.\n\n## A scale problem\n\nBut Aim’s power users — who often do 5K+ runs —were hitting issues.\n\nAfter over 250 pull requests, 1.2K GitHub stars and 200 feature requests. *Live updates, image tracking, distribution tracking*… and Aim 2.0 was hitting the limits of Aim 1.0’s design.\n\nIn order to support the future, we had to make changes to the foundation now.\n\n## Launching Aim 3.0.0\n\nAn additional [317 pull requests](https://github.com/aimhubio/aim/milestone/13?closed=1) later, we are excited to launch Aim v3.0.0 !!!\n\nAs a result, the most important changes include:\n\n**A completely revamped UI**\n\n* Home page and run detail page\n* Runs, metrics and params explorers\n* Bookmarks and Tags\n\n**A completely revamped Aim Python SDK**\n\n* New and much more intuitive (but still quite vanilla) API to track your training runs\n* New and 10x faster embedded storage based on [Rocksdb](http://rocksdb.org/). This will allow us to store virtually any type of AI metadata. On the contrary, [AimRecords](https://github.com/aimhubio/aimrecords) was designed for metrics and hyperparams only.\n\nEnjoy the changes!\n\n![](https://aimstack.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/changes.gif)\n\n## Performance improvements\n\n* Average run query execution time on ~2000 runs: 0.784s.\n* Average metrics query execution time on ~2000 runs with 6000 metrics: 1.552s.\n* New UI works smooth with ~500 metrics displayed at the same time with full Aim table interactions (*for comparison, v2 was performant with limitation for only 100 metrics*).\n\n## Comparisons to familiar tools\n\n### Tensorboard\n\n**Training run comparison**\n\n* The tracked params are first class citizens at Aim. So, you can search, group, and aggregate via params. Aim allows to deeply explore all the tracked data (metrics, params, images) on the UI.\n* With Tensorboard alternative solution the users are forced to record those parameters in the training run name to be able to search and compare. This causes a super tedious comparison experience and usability issues on the UI when there are many experiments and params. After all, TensorBoard doesn’t have features to group, aggregate the metrics\n\n**Scalability**\n\n* Aim can handle 1000s of training runs both on the backend and on the UI.\n* TensorBoard becomes really slow and hard to use when a few hundred training runs are queried / compared.\n\nAim will have the beloved TB visualizations\n\n* Embedding projector.\n* Neural network visualization.\n\n### [](https://github.com/aimhubio/aim#mlflow)MLFlow\n\nMLflow is an end-to-end ML Lifecycle tool. Aim is focused on training tracking. In general, the differences of Aim and MLflow are around the UI scalability and run comparison features.\n\n**Run comparison**\n\n* Aim treats tracked parameters as first-class citizens. Users can query runs, metrics and images. Also, they can filter using the params.\n* MLflow does have a search by tracked config. However, there is no feature availability such as grouping, aggregation, subplotting by hyparparams .\n\n**UI Scalability**\n\n* Aim UI can handle several thousands of metrics at the same time smoothly with 1000s of steps. It may get shaky when you explore 1000s of metrics with 10000s of steps each. But we are constantly optimizing!\n* MLflow UI becomes slow to use when there are a few hundreds of runs.\n\n### [](https://github.com/aimhubio/aim#weights-and-biases)Weights and Biases\n\n**Hosted vs self-hosted**\n\n* Weights and Biases is a hosted closed-source MLOps platform.\n* Aim is self-hosted, free and open-source experiment tracking tool.\n\n## Aim Roadmap[](https://github.com/aimhubio/aim#tensorboard)\n\nWith this version we are also publishing the Aim [roadmap](https://github.com/aimhubio/aim#roadmap) for the next 3 months.\n\nThis is a living document and we hope that the community will help us shape it towards supporting the most important use-cases.\n\nWe are also [inviting community contributors](https://github.com/aimhubio/aim#community) to help us get there faster!\n\n## Why are we building Aim?\n\nWe have started to work on Aim with strong belief that the open-source is in the DNA of AI software (2.0) development.\n\nExisting open-source tools (TensorBoard, MLFlow) are super-inspiring for us.\n\nHowever we see lots of improvements to be made. Especially around issues like:\n\n* ability to handle 1000s of large-scale experiments\n* actionable, beautiful and performant visualizations\n* extensibility — how easy are the apis for extension/democratization?\n\nWith this in mind, we are inspired to build beautiful and performant AI dev tools with great APIs.\n\nOur mission…\n\nAim’s mission is to democratize AI dev tools. We believe that the best AI tools need to be:\n\n* open-source, open-data-format, community-driven\n* have great UI/UX, CLI and other interfaces for automation\n* performant both on UI and data\n* extensible — enable ways to build around for so many use-cases\n\n## Thanks to\n\n[Ruben Karapetyan](https://twitter.com/roubkar) for being the first to believe in this project and spending lots of his time and setting the foundations for the beautiful UI.\n\n[Mahnerak](https://twitter.com/mahnerak) for sharing his problems and continuously testing and coming up with better solutions on UX, features. Also for helping us build the next-gen storage for Aim.\n\nAim users Mohammad Elgaar, Vopani for continuous feedback on our work.\n\nThe contributors who have been relentlessly iterating over the course of the summer.\n\nOn to the next generation of ML tools!!\n\n## Join Us!\n\nJoin the [Aim community](https://slack.aimstack.io/), test Aim out, ask questions, help us build the future of AI tooling!\n\nIf you find Aim useful, drop by and star the repo ⭐","html":"<h2>The origins of Aim</h2>\n<p>In the fateful summer of 2020, our friend <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mahnerak\">mahnerak</a> – a researcher at <a href=\"https://yerevann.com/\">a non-profit lab</a> was hitting the limits of Tensorboard.

At that point Aim users had contributed over 100 feature requests already.</p>\n<h2>A scale problem</h2>\n<p>But Aim’s power users — who often do 5K+ runs —were hitting issues.</p>\n<p>After over 250 pull requests, 1.2K GitHub stars and 200 feature requests. <em>Live updates, image tracking, distribution tracking</em>… and Aim 2.0 was hitting the limits of Aim 1.0’s design.</p>\n<p>In order to support the future, we had to make changes to the foundation now.</p>\n<h2>Launching Aim 3.0.0</h2>\n<p>An additional <a href=\"https://github.com/aimhubio/aim/milestone/13?closed=1\">317 pull requests</a> later, we are excited to launch Aim v3.0.0 !!!</p>\n<p>As a result, the most important changes include:</p>\n<p><strong>A completely revamped UI</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Home page and run detail page</li>\n<li>Runs, metrics and params explorers</li>\n<li>Bookmarks and Tags</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>A completely revamped Aim Python SDK</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>New and much more intuitive (but still quite vanilla) API to track your training runs</li>\n<li>New and 10x faster embedded storage based on <a href=\"http://rocksdb.org/\">Rocksdb</a>. This will allow us to store virtually any type of AI metadata. On the contrary, <a href=\"https://github.com/aimhubio/aimrecords\">AimRecords</a> was designed for metrics and hyperparams only.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Enjoy the changes!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://aimstack.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/changes.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2>Performance improvements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Average run query execution time on ~2000 runs: 0.784s.</li>\n<li>Average metrics query execution time on ~2000 runs with 6000 metrics: 1.552s.</li>\n<li>New UI works smooth with ~500 metrics displayed at the same time with full Aim table interactions (<em>for comparison, v2 was performant with limitation for only 100 metrics</em>).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Comparisons to familiar tools</h2>\n<h3>Tensorboard</h3>\n<p><strong>Training run comparison</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The tracked params are first class citizens at Aim. So, you can search, group, and aggregate via params. Aim allows to deeply explore all the tracked data (metrics, params, images) on the UI.</li>\n<li>With Tensorboard alternative solution the users are forced to record those parameters in the training run name to be able to search and compare. This causes a super tedious comparison experience and usability issues on the UI when there are many experiments and params. After all, TensorBoard doesn’t have features to group, aggregate the metrics</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Scalability</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Aim can handle 1000s of training runs both on the backend and on the UI.</li>\n<li>TensorBoard becomes really slow and hard to use when a few hundred training runs are queried / compared.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Aim will have the beloved TB visualizations</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Embedding projector.</li>\n<li>Neural network visualization.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a href=\"https://github.com/aimhubio/aim#mlflow\"></a>MLFlow</h3>\n<p>MLflow is an end-to-end ML Lifecycle tool. Aim is focused on training tracking. In general, the differences of Aim and MLflow are around the UI scalability and run comparison features.</p>\n<p><strong>Run comparison</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Aim treats tracked parameters as first-class citizens. Users can query runs, metrics and images. Also, they can filter using the params.</li>\n<li>MLflow does have a search by tracked config. However, there is no feature availability such as grouping, aggregation, subplotting by hyparparams .</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>UI Scalability</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Aim UI can handle several thousands of metrics at the same time smoothly with 1000s of steps. It may get shaky when you explore 1000s of metrics with 10000s of steps each. But we are constantly optimizing!</li>\n<li>MLflow UI becomes slow to use when there are a few hundreds of runs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a href=\"https://github.com/aimhubio/aim#weights-and-biases\"></a>Weights and Biases</h3>\n<p><strong>Hosted vs self-hosted</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Weights and Biases is a hosted closed-source MLOps platform.</li>\n<li>Aim is self-hosted, free and open-source experiment tracking tool.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Aim Roadmap<a href=\"https://github.com/aimhubio/aim#tensorboard\"></a></h2>\n<p>With this version we are also publishing the Aim <a href=\"https://github.com/aimhubio/aim#roadmap\">roadmap</a> for the next 3 months.</p>\n<p>This is a living document and we hope that the community will help us shape it towards supporting the most important use-cases.</p>\n<p>We are also <a href=\"https://github.com/aimhubio/aim#community\">inviting community contributors</a> to help us get there faster!</p>\n<h2>Why are we building Aim?</h2>\n<p>We have started to work on Aim with strong belief that the open-source is in the DNA of AI software (2.0) development.</p>\n<p>Existing open-source tools (TensorBoard, MLFlow) are super-inspiring for us.</p>\n<p>However we see lots of improvements to be made.

It can have a huge impact on the training results. There are different ways of using the pseudorandom number generator in ML. Here are a few examples:\n\n* Initial weights of the model. When using not fully pre-trained models, one of the most common approaches is to generate the uninitialized weights randomly.\n* Dropout: a common technique in ML that freezes randomly chosen parts of the model during training and recovers them during evaluation.\n* Augmentation: a well-known technique, especially for semi-supervised problems. When the training data is limited, transformations on the available data are used to synthesize new data. Mostly you can randomly choose the transformations and how there application (e.g. change the brightness and its level).\n\nAs you can see, the random seed can have an influence on the result of training in several ways and add a huge variance. One thing you do not need when tuning hyper-parameters is variance.\n\nThe purpose of experimenting with hyper-parameters is to find the combination that produces the best results, but when the random seed is not fixed, it is not clear whether the difference was made by the hyperparameter change or the seed change. Therefore, you need to think about a way to train with fixed seed and different hyper-parameters. the need to train with a fixed seed, but different hyper-parameters (comes up)?.\n\nLater in this tutorial, I will show you how to effectively fix a seed for tuning hyper-parameters and how to monitor the results using [Aim](https://github.com/aimhubio/aim).\n\n## **How to fix the seed in PyTorch Lightning**\n\n\n\nFixing the seed for all imported modules is not as easy as it may seem. The way to fix the random seed for vanilla, non-framework code is to use standard Python`random.seed(seed)`, but it is not enough for PL.\n\nPytorch Lightning, like other frameworks, uses its own generated seeds. There are several ways to fix the seed manually. For PL, we use `pl.seed_everything(seed)` . See the docs [here](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/0.7.6/api/pytorch_lightning.trainer.seed.html).\n\n> Note: in other libraries you would use something like: `np.random.seed()` or `torch.manual_seed()` \n\n## **Implementation**\n\n\n\nFind the full code for this and other tutorials [here](https://github.com/aimhubio/tutorials/tree/main/fixed-seed).\n\n```\nimport torch\nfrom torch.nn import functional as F\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader\nfrom torchvision.datasets import CIFAR10\nfrom torchvision.models import resnet18\nfrom torchvision import transforms\nimport pytorch_lightning as pl\nfrom aim.pytorch_lightning import AimLogger\n\nclass ImageClassifierModel(pl.LightningModule):\n\n    def __init__(self, seed, lr, optimizer):\n        super(ImageClassifierModel, self).__init__()\n        pl.seed_everything(seed)\n        #

It can have a huge impact on the training results. There are different ways of using the pseudorandom number generator in ML. Here are a few examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial weights of the model. When using not fully pre-trained models, one of the most common approaches is to generate the uninitialized weights randomly.</li>\n<li>Dropout: a common technique in ML that freezes randomly chosen parts of the model during training and recovers them during evaluation.</li>\n<li>Augmentation: a well-known technique, especially for semi-supervised problems. When the training data is limited, transformations on the available data are used to synthesize new data. Mostly you can randomly choose the transformations and how there application (e.g. change the brightness and its level).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As you can see, the random seed can have an influence on the result of training in several ways and add a huge variance. One thing you do not need when tuning hyper-parameters is variance.</p>\n<p>The purpose of experimenting with hyper-parameters is to find the combination that produces the best results, but when the random seed is not fixed, it is not clear whether the difference was made by the hyperparameter change or the seed change. Therefore, you need to think about a way to train with fixed seed and different hyper-parameters. the need to train with a fixed seed, but different hyper-parameters (comes up)?.</p>\n<p>Later in this tutorial, I will show you how to effectively fix a seed for tuning hyper-parameters and how to monitor the results using <a href=\"https://github.com/aimhubio/aim\">Aim</a>.</p>\n<h2><strong>How to fix the seed in PyTorch Lightning</strong></h2>\n<p>Fixing the seed for all imported modules is not as easy as it may seem. The way to fix the random seed for vanilla, non-framework code is to use standard Python<code>random.seed(seed)</code>, but it is not enough for PL.</p>\n<p>Pytorch Lightning, like other frameworks, uses its own generated seeds. There are several ways to fix the seed manually. For PL, we use <code>pl.seed_everything(seed)</code> . See the docs <a href=\"https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/0.7.6/api/pytorch_lightning.trainer.seed.html\">here</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note: in other libraries you would use something like: <code>np.random.seed()</code> or <code>torch.manual_seed()</code> </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2><strong>Implementation</strong></h2>\n<p>Find the full code for this and other tutorials <a href=\"https://github.com/aimhubio/tutorials/tree/main/fixed-seed\">here</a>.</p>\n<pre><code>import torch\nfrom torch.nn import functional as F\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader\nfrom torchvision.datasets import CIFAR10\nfrom torchvision.models import resnet18\nfrom torchvision import transforms\nimport pytorch_lightning as pl\nfrom aim.pytorch_lightning import AimLogger\n\nclass ImageClassifierModel(pl.LightningModule):\n\n    def __init__(self, seed, lr, optimizer):\n        super(ImageClassifierModel, self).__init__()\n        pl.seed_everything(seed)\n        #
