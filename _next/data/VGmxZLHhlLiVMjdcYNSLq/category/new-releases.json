From now on we are going to stick to the Aim versions only regardless of the type of changes to avoid any confusion. [Check out the Aim CHANGELOG](https://github.com/aimhubio/aim/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).\n\nWe have also added [milestones](https://github.com/aimhubio/aim/milestones) for each version. As well as the [Roadmap](https://github.com/aimhubio/aim#roadmap).\n\nCheck out the new features at [play.aimstack.io](http://play.aimstack.io:43900/dashboard).\n\n## Hugging Face integration\n\nHugging Face integration has been one of the most requested features so far and we are excited to finally ship it. Here is a code snippet of easy it is to integrate Aim and Hugging Face.\n\n```\nfrom aim.hugging_face import AimCallback\nfrom transformers import Trainer\n\naim_callback = AimCallback(repo='/log/dir/path', experiment='your_experiment_name')\n\ntrainer = Trainer(\n       model=model,\n       args=training_args,\n       callbacks=[aim_callback]\n    )\n```\n\nHere is how it works: `aim_callback` will automatically open an Aim `Session` and close it when the trainer is done. When `trainer.train()`, `trainer.evaluate()` or `trainer.predict()` is called, `aim_callback` will automatically log the hyper-params and respective metrics.\n\nFind a full example [here](https://github.com/aimhubio/aim/blob/main/examples/hugging_face_track.py).\n\n## Metric Visibility Control\n\nWhen dealing with lots of experiments some metrics may need hide (while still being in the Search) to allow better visibility of the overall picture.\n\nA toggle is now available both for each metric/row as well as for global on/off. Check out the demo below:\n\n![](https://aimstack.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/demo.gif \"Hide individual metrics as well as collectively\")\n\n## Column resize\n\n\n\nWith lots of params tracked, some of them are too wide for table and take over the whole screen real estate. Column resize will allow to fully control data width on the table. Resize is available both on Explore and Dashboard tables.Here is a quick demo:\n\n![](https://aimstack.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/demo2.gif \"Drag column edges back-and-forth to resize\")\n\n## Hide columns with similar values\n\n\n\nMore often than not params have lots of repetition. Especially when tracking 100s of them. In that case the explore table becomes super-noisy.\n\nThis feature allows showing only the relevant info. This has been certainly the missing piece of the column management that many had requested. Here is a quick demo:\n\n![](https://aimstack.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/demo3.gif \"Leave only different columns with a button click, if needed customize afterwards\")\n\n## Logscale\n\n\n\nOne of the must-have features that we hadn’t had a chance to work on. Finally it’s available!!\n\n![](https://aimstack.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/demo4.gif \"log-scale on Aim\")\n\n## New methods for aggregation\n\n\n\nNow you can select different types of aggregations as well as whether to see the whole area or just the aggregated lines.\n\n![](https://aimstack.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/demo5.gif)\n\n## Learn More\n\n[Aim is on the mission to democratize AI dev tools.](https://github.com/aimhubio/aim#democratizing-ai-dev-tools)\n\nWe have been incredibly lucky to get help and contributions from the amazing Aim community. It’s humbling and inspiring.\n\nTry out [Aim](https://github.com/aimhubio/aim), join the [Aim community](https://slack.aimstack.io/), share your feedback.\n\nAnd don’t forget to leave [Aim](https://github.com/aimhubio/aim) a star on GitHub for support 🙌.","html":"<p><a href=\"https://github.com/aimhubio/aim\">Aim</a> 2.2.0 featuring Hugging Face integration is out!
