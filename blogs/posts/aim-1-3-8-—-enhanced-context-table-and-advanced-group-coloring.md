Here are the more notable changes:

### Enhanced Context Table



The context table used to not use the screen real-estate effectively â€” an empty line per grouping, non-efficient column management (imagine you have 200 columns to deal with).

So we have made 3 changes to tackle this problem

### New table groups view

Below is the new modified look of the table. Here is whatâ€™s changed:

* The empty per group is removed
* In addition to the group details popover, there is an in-place list group config is available for instant lookup

* **\[In Progress for next release]**Â Column resize â€” this will allow to manage the wide columns and free much-needed screen real-estate for the data that matters.

### Column Management



This feature allows to seamlessly pin the important columns to both sides of the table and hide the useless columns in between.

You can also re-order the columns by dragging the mid-section up/down.

This is super-handy when dealing with 100s of columns on the table for parameters.

### Advanced Group Coloring



This is the latest iteration over the group coloring.

* Now Aim enables persistent coloring mode which makes sure the group with same configuration always receives the same color.
* You can shuffle the colors in case they arenâ€™t pick to your liking
* You can pick two different color palette for better distribution of the colors.
