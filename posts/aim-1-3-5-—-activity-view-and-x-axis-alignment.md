## Aim Release — Activity View and X-axis alignment

[Aim](https://github.com/aimhubio/aim) v1.3.5 is now available. Thanks to the incredible [Aim community](https://discord.com/invite/zXq2NfVdtF) for the feedback and support on building democratized open source AI dev tools.

Check out the new features at play.aimstack.io

Here are the highlights of the features:

## Activity View on the Dashboard

The **Activity View** shows the daily experiment runs. With one click you can search each day’s runs and explore them straight away

**Statistics** displays the overall count of [Experiments and Runs. ](https://github.com/aimhubio/aim#concepts)

## **X-axis alignment by epoch**

X-axis alignment adds another layer of superpower for metric comparison. If you have tracked metrics in different time-frequencies (e.g. train loss — 1000 steps, validation loss — 15 steps) then you can align them by epoch, relative time or absolute time.

## **Ordering runs both on Explore and on Dashboard**



Now you can order runs both on the Dashboard and on the Explore. Sort the runs by a hyperparam value of metric value on dashboard and explore.

On Explore, when sorted by a hyperparam that’s also used for dividing into subplots, the subplots will be positioned by the hyperparam value too.
