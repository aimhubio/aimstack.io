We have moved the Aim 4.0 to a new repo AimOS and reinstated Aim to its previous version.

Right now you can access the original Aim Experiment Tracker as is through the Aim repo. You can also access the Aim 4.0 as AimOS - an end-to-end modular observability tool for AI systems.

## Why the move?



The [AimOS](https://aimstack.io/blog/new-releases/aim-4-0-open-source-modular-observability-for-ai-systems) mission is to enable a modular end-to-end observability for the AI Systems.



In the first week of the release and user feedback, we admit that Aim 4.0 and [Aim 3.0](https://aimstack.io/blog/new-releases/aims-foundations-why-were-building-a-tensorboard-alternative) are two different products and that the users want both. So we oblige.

The Aim 3.0 is used by many teams and we are sorry for the disruption.

Going forward we are going to maintain both projects. 

Aim 3.0 roadmap has also been updated. Stay tuned for that.
