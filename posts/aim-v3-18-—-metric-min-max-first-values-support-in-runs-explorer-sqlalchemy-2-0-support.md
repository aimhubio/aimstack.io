We have been busy working behind the scenes. Excited to keep sharing updates for Aim more frequently going forward.

# Key Highlights



## Min/max/first values tracking for metrics in UI

The new update lets you track the minimum, maximum, and first values of metrics, giving you deeper insights into your model's performance. This is great for optimizing your model, making it easier to see when and how your model performs best or needs improvement.



Whether it's identifying the peak accuracy of a classification model or the lowest error rate of a predictive model, this metric tracking simplifies the task of fine-tuning models for optimal performance.

## SQLAlchemy 2.0 Support



We've added support for SQLAlchemy 2.0 to ensure you have the latest database management capabilities at your fingertips.



## Improvements in Run Locking and Compatibility



Run locking issues are fixed and we made sure everything works smoothly with older versions of SQLAlchemy.

We're developing new features and improvements that we can't wait to show you :))



Thanks for all love and support. Stay tuned! 🚀
