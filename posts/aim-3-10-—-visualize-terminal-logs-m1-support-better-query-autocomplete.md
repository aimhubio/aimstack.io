Hey team, Aim 3.10 is now available!

We are on a mission toÂ [democratize AI dev tools](https://aimstack.io/blog/new-releases/aims-foundations-why-were-building-a-tensorboard-alternative). Thanks to the awesome Aim community for the help and contributions.

Here is whatâ€™s new in Aim 3.10:

* Visualize terminal logs
* M1 support
* Better autocomplete experience
* Aim citation available
* CatBoost integration
* LightGBM integration

Check out the 3.10 releaseÂ [milestone](https://github.com/aimhubio/aim/milestone/33)Â and theÂ [GitHub Release Notes](https://github.com/aimhubio/aim/releases/tag/v3.10.0)

> *Shout out to Daniel Wessel,Â [arnauddhaene](https://github.com/arnauddhaene),[Â uduse](https://github.com/uduse),Â [lukoucky](https://github.com/lukoucky), Armen Aghajanyan and others for contributions and feedback. We really appreciate it.*

## Visualize terminal logs

When it comes to automating training of multiple runs with job schedulers or workload managers on a cluster, it becomes hard to track theÂ **terminal**Â **logs**Â of the runs.

Now Aim automatically streams the terminal logs to the UI. Near-real-time.

The terminal logs can be turned off if the run instance is created with the following flag in place:

```
aim_run = Run(capture_terminal_logs=False)
```

Check out more about this featureÂ [in Aim docs](https://aimstack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/configure_runs.html?highlight=terminal%20logs#capturing-terminal-logs).

## M1 support

[With the awesome work by the PyTorch team](https://twitter.com/PyTorch/status/1526944876478144512)Â on enabling support for GPU-accelerated PyTorch training on Mac, there has been a huge demand to enable aim on M1 as well.

Aim now supports M1 too. Now you can use Aim withÂ [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/blog/introducing-accelerated-pytorch-training-on-mac/)Â on Mac to track and deeply compare your experiments.

## Better autocomplete experience

We have integrated a rich code autocomplete system as the Aim community loves to deeply query their training runs. This has been a highly requested improvement and a huge productivity booster. Expect more improvements here.

## Aim citation available

Now you can cite Aim from your paper if you are using Aim to compare your experiments.Â [The citation file](https://github.com/aimhubio/aim/blob/main/CITATION.cff).

## CatBoost integration

[CatBoost](https://catboost.ai/)Â is one of the fastest Gradient Boosting on Decision Trees library. Aim now supports CatBoost out of the box. Check out the[Â Aim CatBoost docs here](https://aimstack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quick_start/integrations.html#integration-with-catboost).

Here is a shortÂ [example](https://github.com/aimhubio/aim/blob/main/examples/catboost_track.py)Â that shows how to use AimLogger for CatBoost.

## LightGBM integration

[LightGBM](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)Â is one of the most widely-used and battle-tested gradient boosting frameworks. Due to high-demand we have also added an out-of-the-box Aim LightGBM integration.

[Here is a short code example](https://github.com/aimhubio/aim/blob/main/examples/lightgbm_track.py)Â andÂ [the docs](https://aimstack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quick_start/integrations.html#integration-with-lightgbm)Â on how to use the integration.
