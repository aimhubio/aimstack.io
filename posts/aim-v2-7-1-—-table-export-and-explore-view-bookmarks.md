Aim v2.7.1 is out! We are on a journey to democratize MLOps tools. Thanks to the community for continuous support and feedback!

Check out the updated Aim demo at [play.aimstack.io](http://play.aimstack.io:43900/dashboard).

Below are the two main highlights of Aim v2.7.1.

## Aim Table CSV export

Now you can export both tables from Explore and Dashboard to a CSV file. Afterwards feel free to use the exported CSV file to import in your spreadsheets for reports or just import in your notebook and explore further in other ways (e.g. with [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)) for your MLOps needs.

## Bookmark/Save the Explore State \[experimental]

This new feature helps to save/bookmark the Explore state for future access. The bookmarking ability is particularly helpful to save Explore views that contain certain insights you’d like to revisit.

In the future [releases](https://aimstack.io/blog/new-releases/aim%E2%80%99s-foundations-why-we%E2%80%99re-building-a-tensorboard-alternative), we will build on top of this feature to potentially add notes, fully manage and share them. *For now, this feature is in experimental mode*. Please feel free to share more feedback and how we can improve its experience.
