### Aim - the Inception

We have built [Aim](https://github.com/aimhubio/aim) with the goal to become the best open-source ML experiment, evaluation tracker. Aim has been downloaded over 10 million times by teams and individuals across the whole ML spectrum. However,

**Aim is designed for one person who runs only one project.**

With growing adoption, its clear that the teams need much more than an open-source project.

### AimHub - for Teams

The fundamental use-cases of experiment trackers are: 

* Keep track of all the moving pieces of the experiments
* Enable comparison between the experiments
* Organize the experiments across contributors and environments.

This is especially true if we are dealing with more than one user, more than one project. 

Existing solutions, however

* Are designed to lock you in forever.
* No data-compatibility or an open-source fallback,
* Cost a lot for on-premise installations.

Thatâ€™s exactly what **AimHub IS NOT!**

**AimHub: Easy and collaborative ML experiment tracking for teams.**

We're excited to announce AimHub, the new platform built to help teams easily track and manage their machine learning experiments. ðŸš€

* On your premises
* Compatible with Aim
* Full team, organization, multi-project support

### How AimHub works

AimHub is a wrapper around Aim and enables collaboration on Aim projects. AimHub allows to spin up a new Aim project with a click of a button.

Here are some basic characteristics of AimHub.

* **Easy Deployment:** 

AimHub can be deployed via **Kubernetes** or **Docker Compose**, making it simple to get started in most environments.

* **Integrated & Straightforward:**

Designed for seamless integration with your existing infrastructure, AimHub is fast to deploy,  and fits naturally into your workflow.

* **Team-Centric Project Management:**

After creating your organization, you can build teams, invite members, and manage both public and private projects, offering flexible collaboration across groups.

### Use Cases

Here are two examples of using AimHub and its benefits.

**Faster Model Development**

A Fintech company running hyperparameter sweeps for their internal models.

**Before AimHub:**

> * Engineers used local CSVs or logs
> * It was nearly impossible to reproduce past experiments
> * Cross-team alignment was slow and painful

**After AimHub:**

> * Team tracks every experiment centrally
> * Auto-logging from multiple GPUs with zero config
> * Weekly syncs now start with a live dashboard instead of Excel hell

**Better Teamwork**

Biotech startup training models on medical datasets.

**Before AimHub:**

> * Sensitive data made using closed SaaS tools risky
> * Team had to build internal logging tools from scratch

**After AimHub:**

> * On-prem deployment with full control
> * All model runs securely logged and visualized
> * Reduced custom infra maintenance by 80%

### How to Set up and Use AimHub

Using AimHub is simple and streamlined,

**1. Visit the Docs:**

Head over to the[ AimHub Documentation](https://docs.aimhub.io/) to review setup options and system requirements.    

**2. Install AimHub:**

 Choose your preferred deployment method:

\- Kubernetes: For scalable, production-grade environments.

\- Docker Compose: Ideal for quick local or small-team setups.

**3. Acquire Seat Keys:** 

Once installed, choose your plan and get your **license key for seats** via the email.

**4. Enable and Configure:**

Activate your license, set up your organization, and configure your teams and project structure as needed.

**5. Start Using AimHub:**

Create team, add collaborators, and begin tracking experiments and managing projectsâ€”public or private, all within an intuitive and secure interface.

### Our Vision

We didnâ€™t just build a product. Weâ€™re building a movement:

**Open, accessible, and powerful tools for ML teams everywhere.**

We believe that:

* Experiment tracking should be simple.
* Teams should own their data and infra.
* ML infrastructure should never be a bottleneck.
