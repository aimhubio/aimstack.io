Hey team, Aim 3.6 featuring Mlflow logs converter, Chart export, PyTorch Ignite & Activeloop Hub integrations is now available!

We are on a mission to democratize MLOps tools. Thanks to the awesome Aim community for the help and contributions.

Here is whatâ€™s new in addition toÂ [Aim 3.5](https://aimstack.io/blog/new-releases/aim-3-5-%E2%80%94-tensorboard-logs-support-matplotlib-integration-system-params-logging).

* Export chart as image
* MLflow to Aim logs converter
* Pytorch Ignite integration
* Activeloop Hub integration
* Wildcard support forÂ *aim runs*Â subcommands

*Special thanks toÂ [krstp](https://github.com/krstp),Â [ptaejoon](https://github.com/ptaejoon),Â [farizrahman4u](https://github.com/farizrahman4u)Â from Activeloop,Â [vfdev-5](https://github.com/vfdev-5)Â from PyTorch Ignite,Â [hughperkins](https://github.com/hughperkins),Â [Ssamdav](https://github.com/ssamdav)Â andÂ [mahnerak](https://github.com/mahnerak)Â for feedback, reviews and help.*

## Export chart as image

Hey awesome Aim community, sorry for shippingÂ [this feature](https://github.com/aimhubio/aim/issues/339)Â so late. We know it has been so highly requested, just couldnâ€™t get our hands on it over and over again.

Now the images export is here! You can export charts as JPEG, PNG and SVG so you can include the awesome Aim visuals in your reports and research papers.

You can control the width, height, the format of the downloadable image.

> The ability to add / edit legends will be added in the coming versions.

Would still love to hear feedback on how would you like us to tune this feature.

## MLflow to Aim logs converter

Its been alsoÂ [requested](https://github.com/aimhubio/aim/issues/409)Â across the board by many users. Now you can convert your MLflow logs to Aim so you can compare all of them regardless on where it was tracked.

Here is how it works:

```
$ aim init
$ aim convert mlflow --tracking_uri 'file:///Users/aim_user/mlruns'
```

Besides the metrics, You can convert Images, Texts and Sound/Audios. More on that inÂ [here](https://aimstack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quick_start/convert_data.html#show-mlflow-logs-in-aim).

## Pytorch Ignite integration

For all the Aim users who use PyTorch Ignite, there is now a native PI callback available so you can track your basic metrics automatically!

Here is a code snippet on how to use the PI integration:

```
# call aim sdk designed for pytorch ignite
from aim.pytorch_ignite import AimLogger

# track experimential data by using Aim
aim_logger = AimLogger(
    experiment='aim_on_pt_ignite',
    train_metric_prefix='train_',
    val_metric_prefix='val_',
    test_metric_prefix='test_',
)

# track experimential data by using Aim
aim_logger.attach_output_handler(
    train_evaluator,
    event_name=Events.EPOCH_COMPLETED,
    tag="train",
    metric_names=["nll", "accuracy"],
    global_step_transform=global_step_from_engine(trainer),
)
```

## Activeloop Hub integration

Excited to share that thanks toÂ [an integration with Activeloop](https://activeloop.ai/), starting Aim 3.6 you can add yourÂ [Hub dataset](https://github.com/activeloopai/Hub)Â info as a run param and use them to search and compare your runs across all Explorers.

Here is a code snippet to demonstrate the usage:

```
import hub

from aim.sdk.objects.plugins.hub_dataset import HubDataset
from aim.sdk import Run

# create dataset object
ds = hub.dataset('hub://activeloop/cifar100-test')

# log dataset metadata
run = Run(system_tracking_interval=None)
run['hub_ds'] = HubDataset(ds)
```

The following information becomes available among others:

```
run.hub_ds.version
run.hub_ds.num_samples
run.hub_ds.tensors.name
run.hub_ds.tensors.compression_type
```

Hub is an awesome tool to build, manage, query & visualize datasets for deep learning, as well as stream data real-time to PyTorch/TensorFlow & version-control it. Check out theÂ [Hub docs](https://docs.activeloop.ai/).

Wildcard support for the \`aim runs\` command

OnÂ [Aim 3.5](https://aimstack.io/blog/new-releases/aim-3-5-%E2%80%94-tensorboard-logs-support-matplotlib-integration-system-params-logging)Â we made available theÂ `run mv`Â command which allows to move single runs between folders.

Now we have also added the wildcard to move the whole folder altogether

Here is the CLI interface:

```
$ aim runs --repo <source_repo/.aim> mv * --destination <dest_repo/.aim>
```
