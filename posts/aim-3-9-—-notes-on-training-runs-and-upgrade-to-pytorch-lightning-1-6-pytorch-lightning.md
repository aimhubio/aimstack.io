Hey team, Aim 3.9 is now available!

We are on a mission to democratize AI dev tools. Thanks to the awesome Aim community for the help and contributions.

Here is what’s new:

* Notes on training runs
* Upgrade to Pytorch Lightning 1.6

> Special thanks to ashutoshsaboo, haritsahm and Justin Burton for the help and feedback.

## Notes on the training runs

Now there is an ability to add rich metadata edit (similar to notion) over the runs. It’s been a highly requested feature to be able to leave relevant code, result-related notes, next steps etc on the runs.
