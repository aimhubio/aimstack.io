[Aim](https://github.com/aimhubio/aim)Â community is officially moving to Discord!! ðŸŽ‰

[Join us on Discord](https://community.aimstack.io/), letâ€™s rock and build great things together!!

In this new space we are going to

* be very proactive in sharing next steps, areas of focus and plans
* share weekly roadmap / commitments
* share more community-specific content
* of course continue answering the user questions
* work with the users to build the best open-source experiment tracking tools.

***The slack workspace is going to become deprecated by the end of 2022.***

I also asked a friend on the technical reasons for moving to Discord. Here is what he responded.
